        Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N.
        Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
        You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1].
        There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

        Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards
        under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
        NOTE:
    1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter,
    and partially by another.
    2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards.
    This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
    Return the ans % 10000003.
